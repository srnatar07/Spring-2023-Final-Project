Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I have chosen and researched travel destinations. I have also become familiar with Ren'Py and started a project within the application. I have added the travel agent character
and completed the introductory dialogue. I have completed the function for asking the user if they are ready to begin planning their trip as well a completed the code to ask
the user for their budget. I have also researched common words and phrases and the way in which to say goodbye for all the chosen potential destinations. 

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I still have to write the code which allows the user to look through different travel destinations and choose a destination. I also need to complete the code which will help
the user budget their trip and put together an intinerary. I also have to complete the code which gives the user common words and phrases spoken at the destination of their choice
as well as say goodbye to the user in the language of the destination country. 

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

I am having some trouble with writing the code in Ren'Py. One issues I am having is that the editor I am using in Ren'Py will not allow me to indent. Anothor issue is that
I am not able to properly size and position the images for the background and the travel agent character.
